# Class Naming Conventions

## Avoid IDs for Style Hooks

Don’t use IDs to style elements. Everything that needs styles can be done without IDs. Avoid usage because of their heightened specificity. For more, refer to [CSS Wizardry’s “Pain in the class” blog post](http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/when-using-ids-can-be-a-pain-in-the-class/).

We should still use IDs for [fragment identifiers](http://csswizardry.com/2011/06/namespacing-fragment-identifiers/#fragment-identifiers) as needed.

Rarely, you may be required to style markup that you can't edit where an ID is the _only_ useful selector available (embedded HTML generated by a 3rd party, for example). In this case, use an attribute selector to target that ID without increasing specificity:

```css
/* Targets the exact ID in the 3rd-party content */
.third-party-markup [id='embed-element'] {}

/* Targets any ID that contains `embed-` in the 3rd-party content */
.third-party-markup [id*='embed-'] {}
```

For more on attribute selectors, read [CSS-Tricks' "The Skinny on Attribute Selectors" post](https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/).

## BEM Naming Conventions

Use `.block__element--modifier` syntax for naming classes. Refer to [CSS Wizardry’s "MindBEMding" blog post](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) and the [BEM website](https://bem.info/method/definitions/).

### Blocks

A **block** is a distinct component. Its name can contain single-hyphens ('-') for compound words. The following are all valid blocks:

```css
.card {}
.twitter-embed {}
.nav-item {}
.first-world-problem {}
```

### Elements

An **element** is a child element inside the block. It's written with a double-underscore between the block and the element: `block__element`. Here are some examples of valid element selectors:

```css
.card__title {}
.twitter-embed__username {}
.nav-item__link {}
```

You may occasionally need a grandchild element, but not frequently. Great-grandchildren should be treated as a "[code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell)" that triggers a refactor.

```css
/* Maybe refactor */
.nav-item__link__icon {}

/* Almost always refactor */
.card__title__author__role {}
```

### Modifiers

A **modifier** is a style variation for a block or element. Attach a modifier to the end of a block or element with a double-hyphen (`block--modifier`, `block__element--modifier`).

```css
.card--shadow {}
.twitter-embed--featured {}
.nav-item__link--inverted {}
```

While you might occasionally chain BEM elements to create grandchildren, [avoid chaining modifiers](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2015/01/05/avoid-chaining-modifiers.html). Here are some examples of multiple modifier solutions:

```css
/* Avoid */
.card--shaded--large {}

/* Separate classes for each modifier is good. */
.card--shaded {}
.card--large {}

/* Using a functional (not visual) modifier is also good. */
.card--prominent {}

/* This is good too, but be aware of the increased specificity. */
.card--prominent .card__title--highlighted {}
```

Avoid creating elements as children of modified blocks. Instead, use BEM mixes ([1](https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/#mix), [2](https://en.bem.info/forum/4/))

```css
/* Instead of this: */
.card--prominent__title {}

/* Do this: */
.card__title--prominent {}

/* Or this: */
.card--prominent .card__title {}
```

#### DRY CSS, Wet HTML

When using modifier classes, use both the base class and the modified class in
your markup. Instead of this:

```css
.block,
.block--modifier {
  margin: 10px 0;
}

.block--modifier {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div class="block"></div>
<div class="block--modifier"></div>
```

Try this:

```css
.block {
  margin: 10px 0;
}

.block--modifier {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div class="block"></div>
<div class="block block--modifier"></div>
```

### BEM Leaks

"BEM leaks" can be loosely defined as styles that apply to blocks outside the scope of a stylesheet. For instance, if your project has blocks called `.nav-menu` and `.button`, it might be tempting to write a selector like this:

```css
/* button.css */
.nav-menu .button {}
```

for when a `.button` is in a `.nav-menu`. Instead, try writing classes like this:

```css
/* nav-menu.css */
.nav-menu {}
.nav-menu__toggle {}

/* button.css */
.button {}
```

```html
<nav class="nav-menu">
  <button class="nav-menu__toggle button"></button>
</nav>
```

This will both (a) reduce specificity, and (b) keep all instances of the class name `.nav-menu` in the same place.

## SMACSS Conventions

BEM is our primary class naming pattern, but we also borrow some SMACSS techniques.

### State Classes

The [modifier classes described above](#modifiers) are for style variations that are part of a component's normal state. For style changes that change while the user interacts with the site, [SMACSS's `.is-*` and `.has-*` classes](http://smacss.com/book/type-state) are recommended.

#### `.is-*`

An `.is-*` state class communicates a change on the element itself, for example: `.nav__link.is-active` when a nav link is highlighted to show that it is the current page.

#### `.has-*`

A `.has-*` state class communicates a change having to do with an element's children for example: `.field-group.has-error` when a `fieldset` has an `input` with an invalid value.

#### Scoping States

Typically, a state class should not be styled globally: a modal with `.is-open` requires different styles from an accordion section with `.is-open`; a form with `.has-error` needs different styles from a baseball player's stat-sheet with `.has-error`.

```scss
.nav__link {
  border-bottom: 3px solid transparent;

  &.is-active {
    border-bottom-color: currentColor;
  }
}
.field-group {
  &.has-error {
    outline: 2px solid red;
  }
}
```

### Layout Classes

`layout.css` should only contain global (app-wide), generic layout components, such as `.l-main`, and should be the only file to contain classes with the `.l-` prefix.

```css
.l-main {
  width: calc(100% - 80px);
  max-width: 1280px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

### Typography Classes

Use `.t-*` for reusable type styles. Typical CSS to use here includes font-related properties, color, letter-spacing, text-transform, etc. Here are some examples:

```css
/* Headline styles */
.t-headline {}

/* Body styles */
.t-body {}
```

Avoid putting padding and margin into `.t-*` classes. It's common to modify those properties based on component context; we'd prefer to avoid mixing selectors for those modifications.

Avoid this:

```scss
.t-headline {
  font-size: 12px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;

  .blog-post & {
    margin-bottom: 12px;
  }
}
```

Prefer this:

```scss
.t-headline {
  font-size: 12px;
}

/* A standalone headline block */
.headline {
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}

/* A headline element inside a blog-post block */
.blog-post__headline {
  margin-bottom: 12px;
}
```

Accompanying HTML:

```html
<h4 class="headline t-headline">Lorem ipsum</h4>
<!-- ... -->
<article class="blog-post">
  <h4 class="blog-post__headline t-headline">Dolor sit amet</h4>
</div>
```

## Common Patterns

### "Parent" Selectors

```html
<div class="socials">
  <a class="social social--github" href="https://github.com/dockyard">
    <svg class="social__icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="..."/></svg>
    <span class="t-hidden">GitHub</span>
  </a>
  <a class="social social--twitter" href="https://twitter.com/dockyard">
    <svg class="social__icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="..."/></svg>
    <span class="t-hidden">Twitter</span>
  </a>
  <a class="social social--linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dockyard">
    <svg class="social__icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="..."/></svg>
    <span class="t-hidden">LinkedIn</span>
  </a>
</div>
```

[Here is a JS bin to illustrate this pattern.](http://jsbin.com/jekugoj/edit?html,css,output)

![Footer](assets/footer.png)

Here is a footer with social links. The group of social links would be
called `.socials`, each item is a `.social` and if you need specific
style on the Twitter icon, it would be called `.social--twitter`.

We would rather use its singular form (`.social`) than call each item
`.socials__social`. This is sometimes referred to as the [Plural Parent
Pattern](http://codepen.io/jlong/pen/IzpEJ/).
