# Ruby Style Guide

For code style consistency in Ruby, we have carefully chosen, but relatively linting rules that live per project. Otherwise, we try to adhere to the [bbatsov community style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) that has become the de-facto Ruby community style stanadard.

For bigger picture architectural patterns, look for an ARCH.md file in the Ruby project.
